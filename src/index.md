I'm a software developer (read: typist) and undergraduate who likes to trade sleep for code. I spend a lot of my time learning (books, blogs, podcasts, talks, and various other tech-related things), but can occasionally be found creating something.

I also spend time on [GitHub] and [Stack Overflow].
