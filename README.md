### Aside

The style of JavaScript used in this repository is **not** indicative of my views on how JavaScript is properly written. This is me playing around with the limits of the language, its [ASI][3], and global variables everywhere (all of which are just awful). My personal [style guide][4] outlines how I try to write JavaScript.
