============

The source files for my personal website thingy. I honestly just need a placeholder for the domain, as I'm not really interested in publishing content or blogging or whathaveyou. The page is built ontop of [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/), using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and a modified version of [its Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). Credit to [Yusuke Kamiyamane](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/) for the awesome sulky monkey icon I used for my favicon; I would recommend checking out the [Fugue Icon set](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/) in all its glory.
