Whymarrh
========

Hi there! I'm Whymarrh Whitby, a software developer and undergraduate who likes to trade sleep for code. I spend a lot of my time learning (books, blogs, podcasts, talks, and various other tech-related things), but can occasionally be found creating something.

You can find most of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/whymarrh) and me as `whitby` on Freenode and SynIRC.
