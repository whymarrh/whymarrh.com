My name is Whymarrh
===================

Hi there! I'm Whymarrh Whitby, a software developer and undergraduate. I spend a lot of time in front of a computer and can occasionally be found creating something (somewhat) useful. You can find most of my code on [GitHub] and me idling on [Freenode] and [SynIRC] as `whitby`.
