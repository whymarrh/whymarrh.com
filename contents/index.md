I&rsquo;m a software developer (read: typist) and undergraduate who likes to trade sleep for code. I spend a lot of my time consuming (books, blogs, podcasts, talks, and various other tech-related thingys), but can occasionally be found creating something.

Feel free to take a look at my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/whymarrh).
